# Case for Intel NUC
Here are my updates to an [Intel NUC Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3706360), created by [mraiser](https://www.thingiverse.com/mraiser/). They released their work under a [Creative Commons - Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license while I have (for now?) opted for GNU GPLv3 for SCAD files and a [Creative Commons - Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license for STL files/objects.

I liked their model but wanted a sturdier version. Mainly I also wanted a more protective bottom and figured I'd move the power button hole over as well (instead of just printing a bigger base on the power button).
